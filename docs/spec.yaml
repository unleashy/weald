  title: Weald 🌳 Language Specification
  version: 0.3.0
---
Introduction:
  - >
    Weald is a new programming language taking inspiration from C#, Rust, Ruby, and TypeScript.

    This document describes the language—mostly informally.
---
Lexical elements:
  - >
    This chapter covers the lexical structure of the language. The ◊[source text] of a Weald program
    is transformed into a linear sequence of disjoint input elements: ◊i[tokens], ◊i[white space],
    ◊i[newlines], and ◊i[comments]. These input elements are produced by analysing the source text’s
    code points, from left-to-right, then taking the longest sequence of code points that match a
    particular input element.

  - Source text:
      - ◊syn:
          ◊caption: source text, characters, and initials
          SourceText: Bom? Hashbang? Char* End
          Bom: U+FEFF
          Hashbang: "`#!` CommentChar* CommentEnd"
          Char: ◊p any Unicode code point but not ◊[ForbiddenChar]
          ForbiddenChar:
            - ◊p any Control code point but not ◊[Whitespace] or ◊[Newline]
            - ◊p any Surrogate code point
            - U+2028
            - U+2029
          End: ◊p the physical end of input
      - >
        The source text of a Weald program is a sequence of Unicode code points, encoded as UTF-8.
        No other encoding is supported.

        The source text may start with a ◊abbr[BOM][byte order mark] ◊U[FEFF] which is ignored for
        the purposes of lexical analysis. It can also start with a hashbang line, which is also
        ignored.

        There are certain characters that are ◊syn[forbidden][ForbiddenChar] in source text; if
        source text contains these characters, even within strings or comments, it is an error. If
        the literal defines another way to represent a character, such as through an escape, it is
        allowed, since the literal character is not being represented.

      - ◊rationale: >
          Unicode and UTF-8 are common-sense standards, and usage of other encodings is very minimal
          in 2026. Control characters are forbidden because there is no good reason to have them
          unescaped in a program (same for surrogates). The ◊U[2028] and ◊U[2029] characters are
          forbidden because whilst Unicode recommends them for separating lines, Weald does not
          support them, and forbidding them outright prevents spoofing attacks.

  - White space:
      - ◊syn:
          ◊caption: white space
          Whitespace:
            - U+0020
            - U+0009
            - U+200E
            - U+200F
      - >
        White space is used to separate input elements. It is otherwise insignificant and should be
        ignored. The only white space characters allowed are space and tab, plus the bidirectional
        marks.

        The bidirectional marks must not be the only separators between two ◊[name][Names and
        keywords] tokens.

      - ◊rationale: >
          Most common languages allow either all Unicode code points with property
          ◊i[Pattern_White_Space] as white space or allow some subset of it, often including very
          rarely used characters such as form feed and vertical tab. Weald only allows space and
          tab, as those are essentially the only characters used for white space in modern
          programming.

          Bidirectional marks are allowed because they are needed for Unicode text layout. They are
          forbidden as name separators because they are non-spacing, with no advance width.

  - Newlines:
      - ◊syn:
          ◊caption: newlines
          Newline:
            - U+000A
            - U+000D? U+000A
      - Newlines are used to separate statements from one another. They are the usual LF, CRLF, or
        CR.

      - ◊rationale: >
          Earlier in development, Weald explicitly disallowed CR newlines since they are very rarely
          used. But this made the lexer more complex for little benefit, so they are allowed,
          alongside the very common LF (Unix-style) and CRLF (Windows-style) newlines.

  - Comments:
      - ◊syn:
          ◊caption: comments
          Comment:
            - "`--` CommentChar* CommentEnd"
          CommentChar: Char but not Newline
          CommentEnd:
            - Newline
            - End
      - Comments are treated like white space and are ignored. The newline at the end of line
        comments is emitted as a normal newline token, if present.

      - ◊rationale: >
          Aesthetically, the double dash is pretty neat.

          Block comments were left out as they are not usually that common, and line comments can do
          everything they can without nesting issues. IDE support can help with commenting out large
          blocks of code.

  - Tokens:
      - ◊syn:
          ◊caption: tokens
          Token:
            - NameOrKeyword
            - Boolean
            - Integer
            - Float
            - String
            - Punctuation
      - Tokens are the main input elements consumed by the parser. They include names, keywords,
        booleans, integers, floats, and strings.

  - Names and keywords:
      - ◊syn:
          ◊caption: names and keywords
          NameOrKeyword:
            - Name but not Keyword
            - Keyword
      - >
        Names (also called identifiers) are case-sensitive labels used to refer to variables, types,
        and other entities in a program. Keywords are instances of names reserved for denoting
        syntactical constructs. The value of a user-defined name must not be equal to any keyword.

        The ◊syn[Char] immediately after ◊syn[NameOrKeyword] must not be ◊syn[NameContinue] or
        ◊syn[NameMedial].

      - Names:
          - ◊syn:
              ◊caption: names
              Name: NameStart NameContinue* (NameMedial NameContinue+)* NameFinal
              NameStart:
                - ◊p ◊i[XID_Start] but not ◊i[Default_Ignorable_Code_Point]
                - ◊p ◊i[ID_Compat_Math_Start]
                - "`_`"
              NameContinue:
                - ◊p ◊i[XID_Continue] but not ◊i[Default_Ignorable_Code_Point]
                - ◊p ◊i[ID_Compat_Math_Continue]
              NameMedial: "`-`"
              NameFinal: ◊one-of ? !
          - >
            Names follow ◊[UAX31-R1-1][https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr31/#R1] with the following
            profile, incorporating the Mathematical Compatibility Notation profile and the Default
            Ignorable Exclusion profile:
          - ◊dl:
              Start: >
                XID_Start, plus ID_Compat_Math_Start, plus ◊U[005F], minus
                Default_Ignorable_Code_Point;
              Continue: >
                XID_Continue, plus ID_Compat_Math_Continue, minus Default_Ignorable_Code_Point;
              Medial: ◊U[002D].
          - >
            The Start set is a subset of the Continue set. Names may also be suffixed with at most
            one of question mark ◊code[?] or exclamation point ◊code[!].

            The value of a name is the result of normalising its code points using Normalisation
            Form C. Therefore, two names are equal if their NFC forms are equal.

          - ◊rationale: >
              The vast majority of code uses ASCII exclusively for names, so in theory full Unicode
              support is dispensable, but it’s cool, so it’s in. Math symbols are also in. The fact
              that kebab-case is allowed probably feels strange, but I love kebab-case.

      - Keywords:
          - ◊syn:
              ◊caption: keywords
              Keyword: ◊one-of _ true false
          - >
            Keywords appear literally throughout this specification; every used keyword is listed
            above.

            All keywords use only lowercase ASCII letters, and no new keyword will be defined with
            code points outside that range.

  - Booleans:
      - ◊syn:
          ◊caption: booleans
          Boolean:
            - "`true`"
            - "`false`"
      - >
        Boolean literals represent a logical value that can be either true or false. The value is of
        type Bool.

  - Integers:
      - ◊syn:
          ◊caption: integers
          Integer: Sign? PositiveInteger
          Sign: ◊one-of + -
          PositiveInteger:
            - IntegerDec
            - IntegerHex
            - IntegerBin
          IntegerDec: DigitDec+ (`_` DigitDec+)*
          IntegerHex: "`0x` DigitHex+ (`_` DigitHex+)*"
          IntegerBin: "`0b` DigitBin+ (`_` DigitBin+)*"
          DigitDec: ◊one-of 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
          DigitHex: ◊one-of 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F a b c d e f
          DigitBin: ◊one-of 0 1
      - >
        Integers represent whole numbers. They can be written in decimal, hexadecimal, or binary
        notation.

        The ◊syn[Char] immediately after ◊syn[Integer] must not be ◊syn[NameContinue] or
        ◊syn[NameMedial].
      - ◊note: >
          For example, ◊code[2xl] is an error and not the integer ◊code[2] and the name ◊code[xl].

      - >
        ◊b[Range of an integer.] An integer literal is a 128-bit, two’s-complement quantity, which
        ranges from −2◊sup[127] to 2◊sup[127 − 1]. It is an error if the literal is outside this
        range. The actual value of an integer literal depends on its type, which is inferred from
        context.

      - >
        ◊b[Types of integers.] The type of an integer can be either Nat, Int, or Byte.
      - ◊dl:
          Nat: unsigned 64-bit value ranging from 0 to 2◊sup[64 − 1]
          Int: signed 64-bit value ranging from −2◊sup[63] to 2◊sup[63 − 1]
          Byte: unsigned 8-bit value ranging from 0 to 255
      - >
        This type is inferred from context:
      - ◊ul:
          - If the literal has a negative sign, the type is forced to Int.
          - If the type can ◊i[uniquely] be determined from context, it is that type.
          - If the context under-constrains the type, it defaults to Nat.
          - If the context over-constrains the type, it is an error.

      - >
        ◊b[Determining the value of an integer.] The value of an integer is the value of its sign
        and digits, ignoring underscore separators. This value is interpreted in a specific radix
        depending on the prefix: ◊code[0x] indicates base 16, ◊code[0b] indicates base 2, and no
        prefix indicates base 10. The prefix itself is not part of the value.

        In any of the above cases, the number is negated if it has a negative sign. Then, the final
        value is checked to fit within its inferred type’s range; if it does not fit within the
        integer range of its type, it is an error.

      - ◊rationale: >
          ◊b[The types.] The three integer types were chosen for their usefulness. The odd one out
          is Byte; that one is useful because dealing with files in arbitrary formats is very
          common, and having a dedicated type that isn’t oversized for this purpose is useful.

          It’s useful to have a full set of integer types like C or Rust, that include “midway”
          types like 16-bit integers and 32-bit integers. But for a more high-level language like
          Weald, the added complexity is not outweighed by the benefits. In the interest of
          simplicity, I settled on the three types above.

          Also in the interest of simplicity and for preventing indexing bugs, Java kept out signed
          integers. I thought that was too far; unsigned integers are useful because you often do
          really want to make sure something cannot be negative—most often for an index. Overflow is
          a danger, but say you subtract from zero, and you accidentally index into an array with
          the resulting value that wrapped around (which is probably close to 2◊sup[64 − 1]): the
          index operation will fail, because it’s out of bounds; same as −1 or 9 999 999 would.
          Using signed or unsigned integers for indexing is orthogonal to the permanently
          necessary—and enforced—bounds checking.

          ◊b[The syntax.] The hexadecimal and binary prefixes only accept lowercase ◊tt[x] or
          ◊tt[b]. I don’t know why other languages allow uppercase prefixes, but I thought it was
          rather unnecessary.

          Most other languages don’t parse the positive/negative sign as part of the integer
          literal, instead having it be an application of unary operations. This is totally fine,
          but it adds a bit of complexity for bounds checking the literals, as the parser needs to
          do that check by inspecting the syntax nodes. Parsing the sign as part of the integer
          literal is simpler.

  - Floats:
      - ◊syn:
          ◊caption: floats
          Float: Sign? PositiveFloat
          PositiveFloat:
            - IntegerDec `.` IntegerDec FloatExponent?
            - IntegerDec FloatExponent
          FloatExponent: "`e` Sign? IntegerDec"
      - >
        Floats represent rational numbers and approximations of irrational numbers. The value is of
        type Float.

        The ◊syn[Char] immediately after ◊syn[Float] must not be ◊syn[NameContinue] or
        ◊syn[NameMedial].
      - ◊note: >
          For example, ◊code[3.14e] is an error and not the float ◊code[3.14] and the name ◊code[e].

      - >
        ◊b[Range of a float.] A float is an IEEE-754 binary64 value, with 53 bits of significand
        precision (approximately 15–17 decimal digits). It can represent finite values up to
        ±1.8×10◊sup[308], plus ◊abbr[±∞][positive/negative infinity] and ◊abbr[NaN][not a number].
        Integers in the range ±2◊sup[53] are represented exactly.

      - >
        ◊b[Determining the value of a float.] Compute the mathematical value represented by the
        literal, ignoring underscore separators. Round the value to fit within a binary64 value
        using the ◊tt[roundTiesToEven] rounding mode. If the absolute value is too large to
        represent (overflow), return a signed infinity. If the absolute value is too small to
        represent (underflow), return a subnormal or signed zero as per IEEE 754 rules.

      - ◊rationale: >
          A lot of languages allow floats to be represented with a leading dot ◊tt[.123] or trailing
          dot ◊tt[123.], but this creates unneeded complexity in the lexer just to save one
          character (the zero). So Weald does not interpret leading or trailing dots as float
          literals; you’ll have to put the zero in.

          The ◊tt[e] exponent prefix is not allowed to be uppercase in the interest of simplicity,
          much like the ◊tt[0x]/◊tt[0b] prefix case for integers.

        A string is a sequence of zero or more Unicode code points, resolving to a ◊i[content]
        value. The value is of type String.

        Strings have with multiple literal forms, described below.

        ◊b[Line strings.] Enclosed in one set of quotes. They cannot contain newlines or their own
        quotes. The content of a line string is the sequence of code points within the quotes.

        ◊b[Block strings.] Enclosed in a triple set of quotes. They can span multiple lines and may
        contain their quotes (but not three consecutively). The content of a block string is the
        sequence of code points within the triple quotes, applying the following transformations in
        order:

      - ◊ol:
          - Trim leading and trailing white space and newlines
          - Split the sequence into lines at each ◊syn[Newline]
          - For each line, remove the common leading white space, ignoring blank lines
          - Join the resulting lines with ◊U[000A]

      - >
        The ◊i[content] can then be further interpreted in two ways: standard and raw. In the
        standard form, ◊i[escape sequences] are replaced by their corresponding values. In the raw
        form, escape sequences are treated as literal code points.

        ◊b[Standard interpretation.] Escape sequences are replaced by their corresponding values as
        per the following table:

      - ◊csv:
          ◊caption: escape sequences
          ◊data: |
            Escape sequence,       Replacement
            ◊tt[\◊syn[Newline]],   continuation escape
            "◊tt[\""]",            ◊U[0022]
            ◊tt[\\],               ◊U[005C]
            ◊tt[\e],               ◊U[001B]
            ◊tt[\n],               ◊U[000A]
            ◊tt[\r],               ◊U[000D]
            ◊tt[\t],               ◊U[0009]
            ◊tt[\u◊i[HHHH]],       the code point U+◊i[HHHH]
            ◊tt[\u{◊i[H…]◊tt[}]],  the code point U+◊i[H…]
            ◊tt[\x◊i[HH]],         the code point U+00◊i[HH]

      - Any other escape sequences are an error. Also, the Unicode ◊code[\u \x] escape sequences
        require a valid code point in hexadecimal.

      - ◊b[Continuation escapes.] When this escape is encountered, the newline and any white space
        after are replaced by an empty string. That is, the continuation escape allows line strings
        to span multiple lines. Block strings may also use it.

      - ◊b[Raw interpretation.] Escape sequences are kept verbatim. Raw strings have their quotes
        replaced by backticks.

      - ◊rationale: >
          The string syntax is fairly standard and similar to C#’s. The main difference is the valid
          escape sequences: I removed most of the rarer ones such as ◊tt[\v], ◊tt[\f], and ◊tt[\a],
          and added ◊tt[\e]. The rarer escape sequences are fairly uninteresting when you have
          access to Unicode escapes, but ◊tt[\e] is very useful for printing ANSI escape sequences
          used in terminal formatting—◊code["Hello, \e[31mworld\e[0m!"] is more readable than
          ◊code["Hello, \u001B[31mworld\u001B[0m!"].

          Raw strings use backticks instead of C#’s ◊tt[@]-prefix so that you can write quotes
          within strings without escaping them, which is a fairly common need.

          Interpolated strings will be added later.

Syntax:
  - >
    This chapter covers the syntax of Weald. There are two main groups of syntactical elements:
    declarations and expressions. Whilst declarations put new entities such as variables and
    functions into scope, expressions do the actual work of computation.

  - Optional newlines:
      - ◊syn:
          ◊caption: optional newlines
          NL: Newline*
      - >
        To allow free-form syntax, the grammar allows optional newlines in strategic locations,
        usually next to terminals. To separate statements, newlines are required.

  - Expressions:
      - ◊syn:
          ◊caption: expressions
          Expr: ExprLogic
      - >
        Every expression can be ◊i[evaluated], producing a result. The result ◊i[denotes] a value of
        some type. During evaluation, zero or more ◊i[side effects] may be produced.

        Expressions can be divided into three groups: primary expressions, unary operators, and
        binary operators.

        These can be nested pretty much freely within each other. As such, expression syntax is
        highly recursive. To express the ◊i[precedence] of the various expression forms, a hierarchy
        of syntax productions is used: the topmost ◊syn[Expr] production has the lowest precedence,
        and productions within these productions have the second-lowest precedence, and so on.

        Expressions may have zero or more ◊i[operands], defined by the forms themselves. Those
        operands are used in evaluating an expression at run-time and also for typechecking an
        expression at compile time.

  - Primary expressions:
      - ◊syn:
          ◊caption: primary expressions
          ExprPrimary:
            - Literal
            - Group
            - Block
            - If
      - >
        Primary expressions are the highest-precedence level of expressions: literals, groups, and
        block expressions.

      - Literals:
          - ◊syn:
              ◊caption: literals
              Literal:
                - Name
                - Boolean
                - Integer
                - Float
                - String
          - >
            Literals are simple ◊[tokens]. They denote the value and type of their corresponding
            token.

      - Groups:
          - ◊syn:
              ◊caption: groups
              Group:
                - "`(` NL Expr NL `)`"
          - >
            Groups (also called parenthesised expressions) allow “breaking out” of normal precedence
            by inserting an expression in a high-precedence context. Their value and type are the
            exact same as the expression they contain.

      - Blocks:
          - ◊syn:
              ◊caption: blocks
              Block: "`{` NL Stmts NL `}`"
          - >
            Blocks are a type of expression that allows expressions to contain ◊[statements] by
            grouping them within braces.

      - If expressions:
          - ◊syn:
              ◊caption: if expressions
              If:
                - "`if` NL Expr NL Block NL Else?"
                - "`if` NL Expr NL `?` NL Expr NL `:` NL Expr"
              Else:
                - "`else` NL Block"
                - "`else` NL If"
          - >
            If expressions direct control flow depending on the result of a condition.

            ◊b[Ternary form.] This is meant to reduce the syntax weight of simpler conditionals.
            When using this form, it is an error if any of the nested expressions contain a block.

          - ◊note: >
              This means something like ◊code[if x ? { things } : { more things }] is an error. This
              is meant to discourage overly complex ternary conditionals.

  - Unary operations:
      - ◊syn:
          ◊caption: unary operations
          ExprUnary:
            - ExprPrimary

            - "`-` NL Expr"
            - "`+` NL Expr"
      - >
        The unary operations are composed of an ◊syn[Expr] operand and an associated operator; the
        operators are not ◊tt[!], minus ◊tt[-], and plus ◊tt[+]. The operators all have the same
        precedence and are all right-associative, that is, ◊code[-+x] is the same as ◊code[-(+x)].

  - Exponentiation operation:
      - ◊syn:
          ◊caption: exponentiation
          ExprPower:
            - ExprUnary NL `^` NL ExprPower
            - ExprUnary
      - >
        The exponentiation operation is a binary, right-associative operation.

  - Multiplicative operations:

            - ExprMul NL `%` NL ExprPower
            - ExprPower
      - >
        The multiplicative operations comprise the multiplication ◊tt[*], division ◊tt[/], and
        modulo ◊tt[%] operators. They are all binary, left-associative, and have the same
        precedence.

  - Additive operations:
      - ◊syn:
          ◊caption: additive operations
          ExprAdd:
            - ExprAdd NL `+` NL ExprMul
            - ExprAdd NL `-` NL ExprMul
            - ExprMul
      - >
        The additive operations comprise the add ◊tt[+] and subtract ◊tt[-], operators. They are
        both binary, left-associative, and have the same precedence.

  - Comparison operations:
      - ◊syn:
          ◊caption: comparison operations
          ExprCmp:
            - ExprAdd NL `==` NL ExprAdd

            - ExprAdd NL `<`  NL ExprAdd
            - ExprAdd NL `<=` NL ExprAdd
            - ExprAdd NL `>`  NL ExprAdd
            - ExprAdd NL `>=` NL ExprAdd
            - ExprAdd
      - >
        The comparison operations comprise the equality ◊tt[==], inequality ◊tt[!=], less than
        ◊tt[<], less than or equal to ◊tt[<=], greater than ◊tt[>], and greater than or equal to
        ◊tt[>=] operators. They are binary, non-associative (you cannot chain them together without
        using parentheses), and have the same precedence.

  - Logical operations:
      - ◊syn:
          ◊caption: logical and/logical or expressions
          ExprLogic:
            - ExprAnd

            - ExprCmp
          ExprAnd: ExprAnd NL `&&` NL ExprCmp
          ExprOr: ExprOr  NL `||` NL ExprCmp
      - >
        The lazy logical operations comprise the logical and ◊tt[&&] and logical or ◊tt[||]
        operators. They are binary, left-associative, and have the same precedence, but you cannot
        chain ◊tt[&&] with ◊tt[||] (or vice versa) together without using parentheses.
