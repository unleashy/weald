Introduction:
  - >
    Weald is a new programming language taking inspiration from C#, Rust, and Ruby.

    This document describes the language—mostly informally.

Lexical syntax:
  - >
    This chapter covers the lexical structure of the language. The ◊[source text] of a Weald program
    is transformed into a linear sequence of disjoint input elements: ◊i[tokens], ◊i[whitespace],
    ◊i[newlines], and ◊i[comments]. These input elements are produced by analysing the source text’s
    code points, from left-to-right, then taking the longest sequence of code points that match a
    particular input element.

  - Source text:
      - >
        The source text of a Weald program is a sequence of Unicode code points, encoded as UTF-8.
        No other encoding is supported.

        The source text may start with a ◊abbr[byte order mark][BOM] ◊U[FEFF] which is ignored for
        the purposes of lexical analysis.
